INTRODUCTION

 This document wants to give an insight to zarafa-postfixadmin and the reason it
 was invented.
 
 Small office or home setups are not connected to LDAP, Active Directory or
 other enterprise user management systems. For this purpose zarafa-server's
 come with an integrated command line user management plugin. Badly persons
 who are responsible for mailbox administration don't alway have technical
 skills or command line root access. This gap is filled perfectly by Postfix Admin.
 
 Postfix Admin is a web based interface used to manage mailboxes, virtual
 domains and aliases.
 
 Zarafa-Postfixadmin extends its function so it can manage zarafa, too. Basically it
 consists of two parts.
 
  - Customization to the official customiziation interface
  - Worker-Service that walks the Postfix Admin log and runs
    the actions to zarafa-admin
